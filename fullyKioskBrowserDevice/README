Hubitat solution for Fully Kiosk Browser

If you turn on Image Capture Timeout suggest changing on devices:
  "Event history size, per event type" to 5
  "State history size, per attribute" to 15


You can load sounds locally by going to settings->file manager then update (for example with local IP address)
  "Audio Media URL (Chime):" to http://192.168.1.160/local/doorbell.mp3
  "Audio Alarm URL:" to http://192.168.1.160/local/alarm.mp3
